## Career Transitions
- **Net Group → Katana MRP (2022):** Was invited by a friend. It wasn't about money - he wanted to work for a company with its own product and feel he was making an impact.
- **Katana MRP → ObsidianOS (2025):** Left due to major layoffs (30%+ of staff) after the company didn't reach investor promises.
- **ObsidianOS → Open to opportunities:** Was unexpectedly replaced during his vacation by a founder's long-time friend. The reason given was "cultural fit," which was surprising given he had even participated in cultural fit interviews on behalf of the founder and this was never raised in monthly 1:1s.

## What Mihkel Is Looking For
- **Position level:** Senior or Lead roles
- **Role type:** Full Stack, Frontend-oriented, or pure Frontend positions. Pure backend roles don't interest him much (would need to be an exceptional offer)
- A good team (even 2 people counts as a team!)
- TypeScript environment
- React on frontend
- Node.js on backend preferred, but open to Python or Java (quick to get familiar)
- A workplace where he can grow and impact the product
- Being valued as a team member
- Prefers remote work, but open to discussing on-site/hybrid depending on the offer and location (Estonia, UK, or elsewhere in Europe)

## Notable Achievements at Katana MRP
One of his last features was so large it got split into two separate features, each with 70-100 tickets (one ticket ≈ 2 days of developer work). He was responsible for:
- Planning the architecture and design
- Drawing dependency maps
- Coordinating solutions across multiple teams and microservices
- Creating tickets for teammates

Example: Implementing additional costs for purchase orders and manufacturing orders, which involved dealing with inventory cost calculations and how it affects future manufacturing when buying ingredients at different costs. Also implementing product reservations for manufacturing orders, so the system knows to exclude reserved items from future availability calculations.

## LinkedIn Recommendations (from Katana MRP colleagues)

**Taago Kilter** (Senior Product Manager):
"Mihkel is driven to fully understand the impact he's delivering, not just do what is told. He has the right balance of asking questions and finding answers himself - he intuitively knows what problems need business decisions vs. what he can validate with fellow engineers. He could easily enter unfamiliar territory and navigate through it, always coming up with a solid plan. A mature teammate who is critical when needed, yet constructive always."

## Fun Facts
- **The Head Chef Story (2014)**: While looking for a summer job before 12th grade, Mihkel got a kitchen helper position at NYC Piano Bar in Tallinn's Old Town through a friend who worked there as a chef. The head chef got fired after Mihkel's first week for not doing anything, and then his friend went on vacation the second week - leaving 17-year-old Mihkel alone to run the entire kitchen for 2 weeks. He handled everything: daily inventory checks, ordering ingredients every morning, preparing daily lunch specials, cooking all dishes, and cleaning until midnight. His schedule was 8 AM to midnight, with a 1-hour commute from outside the city. Zero cooking experience to solo head chef in 3 weeks - talk about being thrown into the deep end!
- In 2019, he reached #1 in Estonia in Rocket League 2v2 ranked mode!
- During autumn, he goes mushroom picking almost every free day - it's a serious seasonal hobby!
